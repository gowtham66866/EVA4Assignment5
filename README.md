Things tried:

Trial1:Added larger input and output channels ie considered the lighter model along with Batch normalisation and running for 15 epochs.
Trial2:Add dropout and BAtchNormization to a lighter model.
Trial3:Add Gap and more layers at the end along with Dropout and Batch Normalisation to a lighter model.
Trial4:Add Rotation and increased model capacity to Trial3.
Final: Increased dropout, added LR scheduler and reduced input and output channel values.
EVA4S4Final.ipynb file has 99.4 accuracy and parameters <1000.
